# Music Bingo

A Proof-of-Concept Android Application of the popular adaption of Bingo using music instead of numbers, published as part of my final year project for college

Made using Kotlin, Spotify API and TCP Sockets

Note: The project will not likely work when running likely, for insight into how the project looks and works see the [Documentation](https://github.com/Jaymepower/Final-year-project/blob/main/Music%20Bingo%20Documentation.pdf)
